              <strong>(Who are you?)</strong> I am a sort of a broken mirror. I
              mean, sometimes I don't recognise myself.
              <strong
                >(If you could change anything in your life, what would it
                be?)</strong
              >
              Everything. I would step into a time machine and go back to when I
              was 25. No... seriously... I would try to change something, find a
              home, a room, anything. And be on my own, which is what I most
              yearn for and most enjoy... being on my own.
            </p>

            <p>
              My name is Daniel. Daniel... I am Brazilian, I have been here, in
              Portugal, since I was seven years old. I am 47 . I am in this
              situation because... life took a turn, and I ended up here to
              solve the problems I 've had here... Several mistakes I made
              throughout this process. I would definitely change them, I would
              try to do better. I would try to be a better person. Maybe I
              wouldn't make those mistakes so I wouldn't get back... so I
              wouldn't end up in the situation I'm in.
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't know who I am. Right now, I don't know who I am. That's
              all I can say. [...] Probably I wouldn't have been born. That's
              the only thing I would change in my life. At this stage, maybe if
              I hadn't been born... no... I wouldn't have so much...
            </p>

            <p>
              I don't know who I am. And I would like to change my life. But I
              will achieve what I want.
            </p>

            <p>
              I consider myself a shy extrovert. A shy person... quiet, keeping
              to myself... until I feel confident with the people I spend my
              days with. Then I start to loosen up, start joking around, and so
              on...
              <strong>(What would change in your life?)</strong> Absolutely
              nothing. I've reached a point in my life where I can see that we
              are where we are, at the time we are, at the moment we are meant
              to be.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>( Mr António, who are you?)</strong> At the moment, I
              don't consider myself to be anyone. <strong>(No?)</strong> At the
              moment, I think I'm nobody. <strong>(No?)</strong> No. My life is
              upside down and at the moment I think I'm nobody.
              <strong>(But what is the reason?)</strong> The reason is... it's a
              divorce I had. <strong>(Very well.)</strong> [...] My whole life
              would change. Upside down. Everything. From start to finish.
              <strong

                like to do that too.)</strong
              >
              I would have to change everything.
              <strong>(Very good. Me too. I'm just the same.)</strong> And I'm
              trying, and I'm succeeding.
              <strong>(Even I will succeed too.)</strong>

              Hello, I'm Noel Paiva. I would like one thing, just one. For
              politicians to pay more attention to the homeless and the
              conditions in which they live. And for institutions to help.
              That's it, what I feel inside, my revolt.
              <strong
                >(If you wanted to... or could change something in your life,
                what would it be?)</strong
              >
              I would change it, yes. At least the way people see the homeless.
              And... It really is a distorted view. And the State,
              unfortunately, doesn't pay any attention. In this case, the
              government. That's what I would like to change.
            </p>

              >
              What would it be? I'd like to go back to my hometown.
            </p>

            <p>
              Who am I? <strong>(Yes.)</strong> A human being called Ana Paula,
              born in 1962, now 63 years old. I am someone who... is very
              stubborn when it comes to achieving my goals. I am not negative. I
              like to help everyone. In whatever way I can, right? And, well,
              I'm already a mother, I'm already a great-grandmother... look,
              it's a life! [...] I never would have got married. For one thing.
              Right. And then? If I could and I had some money, I would start my
              own business.
            </p>

            <p>
              It's a discovery. Until the end of life. It's continuous learning.
              It's a learning process. In the long term. Until the last breath.
              I think chance has the hand of God. So I wouldn't change anything,
              otherwise I wouldn't be who I am now. There would always be some
              difference... So I accept what I've been given. And that when...
              it's constituted. It constituted me as a being - a person.

            <p>
              Alexandre Magalhães. I work here. I'm a caretaker. And basically,
              I manage operations. There's not much else to say, professionally
              speaking. No, I'm not a film buff. I like cinema. I like going to
              the cinema. And I like watching films without labels [...] That's
              a difficult question. I don't think I would change anything in
              particular. I wouldn't change anything in particular. Basically,
              it would be difficult to know what to change, because... We are
              who we are and we try to do the best we can with who we are. No, I
              wouldn't change anything.
            </p>

            <p>
              How can I put it? It's me. I would change everything. A lot would
              change in my life. I would never do the stupid things I've done.

              For the better.
              <strong>(But what is the better you would like?)</strong> To have

              I wouldn't want to change... I wouldn't want to change anything.
              However, I would like not to exist in this job. That is, in a
              perfect world, this shouldn't exist. Right?
              <strong>(Right.)</strong> And so, I would give up everything I am
              so that we could all be truly whole. <strong>(Yes.)</strong> I
              think that would be the easiest thing for me to do.
              <strong>(Yes, sir.)</strong> I would do it quite easily.
              <strong>(Very well, Mr Jesus.)</strong>

              and other illnesses I have, problems I have, I can't walk. It's
              just that, otherwise I can't turn it around. And on a personal

              is to start working only for my art, to live off my art, that's

              would I change in my life? That's a difficult question, because
              I'm a very happy person, I have the best family in the world, I
              have the best boyfriend in the world, I have my own business, I
              have good friends... But maybe... Maybe just a little bit... I
              would make sure I had a better quality of life. That's what I
              would change in my life, because I don't have much quality of life
              and I would like to have more quality of life.

              likely, thinking about it, what I would change in my life, if I
              could... Perhaps have a better quality of life too, enjoying it...
              but in the sense of also being able to help more people, because
              there are many people out there who are also in need. Fortunately,
              I am comfortable and relaxed, but if I had the means, I would help
              more people.

              like to have more time and comfort for things that make me feel
              good. Like activities that are sometimes difficult because of free
              time, resources, being with people, eating better, things that

              deal with that sensitivity through art, through things I like to
              do and through love. [...] It's not that I haven't done it, but
              maybe I would have spent more time with certain people.

              My name is Augusto and I have been working in social care for ten

              also linked to social welfare. I was born in an orphanage and I
              was also raised by godparents, which made me a very compassionate
              person and led me to become involved in social work, such as the
              Albergues. And that's it. And that's what makes me live here and
              work hard every day, knowing that I can help someone.

              Maybe my very personal way of... I mean, I'm very stubborn in my
              ideas, and I also think I would try to change things in the past.
              Perhaps... there were things in life with people that... perhaps
              because I had this fixed idea... led me to make hasty decisions,
              perhaps even with people in my family, but perhaps that... I would
              go back in time and try to do things differently. But that is
              life, we make good decisions, bad decisions, the important thing
              is to live.
